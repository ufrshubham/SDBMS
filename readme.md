# *SDBMS* : Student Database Management System

## History
SDBMS is just a pythonic recreation of a console application that I created way back in 2012. The original project was a
product of my limited C++ knowledge and some really nasty hacks. I still cannot comprehend the idiotic code I wrote at
that time. I think I was not totally comfortable with have multiple files for my source code and as a result my entire 
project consisted only of a single file.

Fast forwarding to present day, for some reason I just wanted to see if I can write a better version of the same project
with some thing that I'm still learning. They only reason I choose python for this pet project was to make my self more 
used to doing things the pythonic way.

## Requirements
 - Python 3.x
 - Tkinter

## Disclaimer
I'm no expert in programming. So you a sure to find many beginner's mistakes in my code.
